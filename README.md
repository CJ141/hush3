# HUSH 3

## What is HUSH?

![Logo](doc/hush/hush.png "Logo")

HUSH (formerly Zdash) is a code fork of [ZCash](https://z.cash/) which has it's own genesis block.
Based on Bitcoin's code, it intends to offer a far higher standard of privacy
through a sophisticated zero-knowledge proving scheme that preserves
confidentiality of transaction metadata.

This software is the HUSH node and command-line client. It downloads and stores the entire history
of HUSH transactions; depending on the speed of your computer and network
connection, the synchronization process could take a day or more once the
blockchain has reached a significant size.

**HUSH is unfinished and highly experimental.** Use at your own risk!
